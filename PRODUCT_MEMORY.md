## Interaction Principle

For this gym bot, interactive buttons must remain a first-class UX path.

- Never force the user to type commands in a rigid predefined format as the only way to proceed.
- Always provide guided, low-friction interaction options (buttons/prompts) for core actions.
- Free-text input can be supported as a convenience and fallback, not as the sole required interface.
